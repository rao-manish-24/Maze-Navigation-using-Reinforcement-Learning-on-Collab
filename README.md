# Maze-Navigation-using-Reinforcement-Learning-on-Collab

This project demonstrates how reinforcement learning (RL) techniques can solve maze navigation problems effectively. 
The approach leverages Q-learning, a popular RL algorithm, to train an agent to find an optimal path from a starting point to a target within a maze environment.

# Features
# Key Highlights
 Custom Maze Environment: Users can define their own maze with walls, paths, and goals.
 
 Q-Learning Algorithm: Implements Q-learning, with support for hyperparameter tuning to optimize learning.
 
Visualization: Offers real-time visualization of the agent's path and learning progress.

Performance Metrics:
Evaluates the agent's navigation using metrics such as:

Total path length
Number of turns
Branching points
Path efficiency
Manhattan distance to the goal

# Results
A sample output includes:

Path Length: 29 steps
Turns: 9
Branching Points: 7
Efficiency: 0.97
Manhattan Distance: 28

# Prerequisites
Make sure the following libraries are installed:

Python (>=3.6)
NumPy: For numerical computations
Matplotlib: For visualization
Jupyter Notebook: To run and interact with the code
Optional: pandas for detailed reporting and data analysis
Install dependencies using:

pip install numpy matplotlib notebook pandas
# Workflow

# Step 1: Maze Setup
Define the maze grid, specifying start and goal points as well as obstacles.

# Step 2: Q-Learning Implementation
States: Each cell in the maze.
Actions: Possible moves (up, down, left, right).
Rewards:
Positive reward for reaching the goal.
Penalty for hitting walls or taking longer paths.
Exploration Strategy: Epsilon-greedy policy for balancing exploration and exploitation.

# Step 3: Agent Training
The Q-table is updated iteratively using the Bellman equation.
Hyperparameters such as learning rate, discount factor, and epsilon can be adjusted for fine-tuning.

# Step 4: Evaluation
After training, the agent's performance is assessed using:
Path metrics (length, turns, efficiency).
Visualization of the learned optimal path.


# Customization
Modify the maze dimensions, obstacles, and reward settings to test various scenarios.
Experiment with hyperparameters like:
Learning rate (α)
Discount factor (γ)
Exploration factor (ϵ)

# Example Output
